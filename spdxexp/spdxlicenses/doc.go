/*
Spdxlicenses package provides functions to get licenses, deprecated licenses, and exceptions.  These are auto-generated and should not be modified directly.
Licenses are generated from the [SPDX official machine readable license list].

In addition, this package includes a function to return license ranges for sequential licenses and ranges including modifiers (i.e. -only, -or-later).
